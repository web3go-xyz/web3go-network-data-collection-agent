How does it work?
Innovative Trading Model


Order book and market depth displays are removed. The ALP pool provides liquidity for all trading pairs to maximize capital efficiency. Users who mint ALP participate in the market-making of V2 perpetual contracts. The fluctuation in ALP token price is correlated with the value of the ALP pool and its profits and losses — PnL of the ALP pool will cause ALP price to rise or fall.
