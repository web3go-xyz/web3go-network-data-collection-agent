Exploration
Players explore galaxies on their spaceships in search of rare planets to mine. In return, they can receive rAPX as rewards. While exploring, players also stand to win attractive prizes.
How to Start
Select galaxy
To start exploring, players need to select a galaxy. Rarer galaxies contain rarer planets that can be discovered. Of course, the EP required to explore these galaxies will also be higher.
Rare Planet Odds = (EP ^ 1.5 - 100) / (Difficulty / 10) x Galaxy Boost 
Galaxy requirements 
Each galaxy has its own rarity requirements. Only spaceships that meet the requirements can begin exploring.

​Set Up Your Exploration Plan
Select your spaceship
You can select a spaceship to predict coin trends. If the coin attribute matches the market price movements during the exploration time, your rewards will be boosted. Successful predictions will also win points that count towards the Leaderboard, where top players get to split the prize pool.
Select the number of planets to explore 
Select the number of planets and pay the corresponding 
Fuel Fee
. This does not mean you will get to explore the number selected, as you may be limited by your EP. For instance, you may have spent 
Fuel Fees
 for 5 planets but your EP only allows you to explore 1.
Exploration success rate 
Players can explore a maximum of 5 planets each time. The success rate for the first planet is 100%, and will decrease incrementally with each subsequent planet.
During the exploration time, the spaceship will continue to search for the next planet. If the exploration ends without discovering another planet, it means that there are no further planets discovered. For instance, if the player sets out to explore 5 planets but only discovers 3 planets by the end of the exploration time, the 4th and 5th planets were not discovered successfully. The total number of planets explored in the game is 3. ​

Select exploration time
You can choose to explore for 15, 30, 45, or 60 minutes. Exploring for a longer time means you will experience a larger increase/decrease in rewards depending on whether your prediction is successful. ​

​Introduction to Coin Trend Prediction ​
​
Auxiliary Ship
The Auxiliary Ship is primarily used to assist mining. The number of rAPX mined will be multiplied by the number of Auxiliary Ships utilized during exploration. Hence, the more Auxiliary Ships you have during exploration, the more rAPX you will receive accordingly. For instance, if you were originally able to mine 10 rAPX and you have 15 Auxiliary Ships, you will be able to mine 150 rAPX.
However, the more Auxiliary Ships you utilize, the higher the 
fuel fees
 you will incur.
Exploration cycle 
Each spaceship can only be used once a day for exploration. This will be refreshed daily at 12:00 UTC.

Mining planets 
After discovering a planet, players can start mining. Each planet will have its own available mining capacity. The rarer the planet, the greater the capacity. Players should not expect to mine 100% capacity each time as the output depends on the Mining Rate, which is determined by the MP and Difficulty. The higher the MP, the easier the mining. The higher the Difficulty, the more challenging it will be to mine.
Basic Mining Rate (MAX 100%) = (MP - Difficulty / 100) ^ 1.5 / (Difficulty / 10) ^ 1.5
Mining Rate = Basic Mining Rate x (0.8-1.2) 
Output = Mining Rate x Available Mining Capacity
