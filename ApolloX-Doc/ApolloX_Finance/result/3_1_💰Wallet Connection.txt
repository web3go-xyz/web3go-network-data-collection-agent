Connect Metamask to Binance Smart Chain (BSC)
Metamask is a decentralized wallet on ERC20. It can be installed on your Web Browser (e.g. Chrome), IOS or Android mobile phone. If you would like to download Metamask, kindly go to the 
Download Page
.
For the following demo, we are using the Metamask IOS app. Donâ€™t worry, the steps for all platforms are similar.
After you create or log in to your wallet account, you may check the Network on the top. It shows which blockchain network you are on. Click and it will show all the networks you have.
As we can see, there is no BSC network. In this case, we need to add BSC to your Metamaskï¼š
