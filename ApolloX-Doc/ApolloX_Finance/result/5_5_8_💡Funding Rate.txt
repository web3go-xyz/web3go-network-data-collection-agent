Funding Rate
A Funding Rate is a periodic payment made to long or short traders based on the price difference between the market price of the perpetual contract and the spot price. When the market is bullish, the Funding Rate is positive and long traders pay a funding fee to traders who are short. Conversely, when the market is bearish, the funding rate is negative and short traders pay the funding fee to long traders.
ApolloX does not charge any fees for funding rate transfers, as funds are transferred directly between users. Funding fees on ApolloX are taken every 8 hours at 00:00 UTC, 08:00 UTC, and 16:00 UTC. Traders are only liable for funding payments in either direction if they have open positions at the predetermined funding times. Traders who do not have an open position will not pay or receive any funding.
Note: There is a 15-second deviation between the actual time and the time the funding fee is taken. For example, if you open a position at 16:00:05 UTC, you may still be charged a funding fee. Therefore, it is important that you pay attention to the exact time you open a position.
In order to maintain the stability of the market, ApolloX will calculate the funding rate for certain trading pairs based on the gap between long and short positions. Detailed calculation method as below:
abs(funding rate)=clamp{ floor,abs(Long OI - Short OI) * Interest Rate of hour / M,cap}
 IF Long OI> Short OI,Funding Rate=abs(funding rate)
IF Long OI< Short OI,Funding Rate=-abs(funding rate)
IF Long OI= Short OI,Funding Rate=0
Parameters:
Long IO is the total long positions value, Short OI is the total short positions value
Interest Rate of hour, the funding fee will be charged every two hours.
M is the maximum position size 
Effective date of trading pairs : All BUSD trading pairs (Updated on 9 February 2023)
â€‹
Examples:
If the long position size is 100 BUSD, short position size is 200 BUSD, the limitations for both long and short position is 200 BUSD, then the net position of marker maker is +100 BUSD, interest rate will be 5%. According to the formula:
abs(funding rate)=claim{ 0.00001,100 * 0.05  / M,0.1}=0.025
IF Long OI< Short OI
Funding Rate =-abs(funding rate)=-2.5%


then, 
Short positions need to pay this funding feeï¼š 200 *2.5%=5 BUSD
Long positions receive this funding feeï¼š100* 2.5%=2.5 BUSD
Market maker of ALP pool receive this funding feeï¼š100*2.5%=2.5 BUSD
