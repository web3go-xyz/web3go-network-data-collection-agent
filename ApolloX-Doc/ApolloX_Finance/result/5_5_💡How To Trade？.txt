How To Tradeï¼Ÿ
ApolloX ALP-PERP contracts trading differs from the usual contract model. The transaction price of ALP-PERP contracts is equivalent to the mark price plus platform slippage. That said, the first three ALP-PERP contracts BTCBUSD, ETHBUSD and BNBBUSD will have zero slippage trading, hence their mark price is the final transaction price. This model has a low transaction threshold and no order book, ensuring that users will be able to trade as close as possible to the mark price. Currently, users can only trade ALP-PERP in Lite mode. However, they will be able to close ALP-PERP positions in Classic mode under the â€˜Positionsâ€™ section.
