Opening a position
Users can choose to "Buy/Long" or "Sell/Short" to open their positions with leverage.
Long position: If the price rises, you will earn a profit. If price falls, you will make a loss.
Short position: If the price falls, you will earn a profit. If price rises, you will make a loss.
â€‹
Reminder: When users trade ALP-PERP contracts, they trade directly with the ALP liquidity pool. ALP-PERP does not use an order book and has low slippage. ALP-PERP contract price will be anchored using the current mark price and fixed slippage. (Fixed slippage is mainly used to deter price manipulation)
â€‹
When the ALP liquidity pool is profitable, it drives up the price of ALP. The main sources of profit are derived from contract trading income, forced liquidation fees, etc.
â€‹
Please note: The transaction volume contributed by the ALP contract will not be included in the trading rewards activity, however users may use APX as fee deduction.
