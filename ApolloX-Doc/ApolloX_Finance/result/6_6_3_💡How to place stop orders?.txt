How to place stop orders?
Users can set 
[Take profit]
 and 
[Stop loss]
 orders when they are placing their orders. When opening a position, users can set a take profit or stop loss price. When the specified price is reached, the order will be executed. If UnrealizedPNL<= 90%, the user's position will be liquidated. At the same time, the unrealizedPNL cap of each trade will be 90%. Even if users do not place any take profit or stop loss orders, the unrealizedPNL cap will be set at 90% by default.
