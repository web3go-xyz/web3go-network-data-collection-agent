The photo must be taken on the day of your order. Failure to follow instructions may result in your order being delayed or cancelled. Please also note that creating the order does not necessarily mean you have passed verification. The process is happening in the background, and if you do pass it, your order will be fulfilled.

If there is no any updates from Banxa after 12 hours, kindly contact their customer support team.

Banxa will notify you of any order updates via emails, such as when the payment is received, when the transfer started, when the order is fulfilled, etc.

When the transfer starts, you can check your transaction status on the blockchain network. You will receive a link in the email to check how your order is progressing. When your order is fulfilled, i.e. the transfer is completed and the transaction is verified on the blockchain network, your purchased crypto will be visible in your Wallet.


Note:
 The fact that the transfer started does not necessarily mean it is confirmed on the blockchain right away (this takes time and is dependent on the network speed). Please wait patiently. If there is any issues regarding to the transaction, kindly contact Banxa directly.
