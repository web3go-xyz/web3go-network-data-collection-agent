Rewards Distribution Rules
ALP Staking Rewards Formula


Annual Percentage Rate (APR)
 = [(Number of blocks produced by Binance Smart Chain (BSC) per day * Number of APX rewards per block * Price of APX) / (Total number of ALP staked * Price of ALP)] * 365
Binance Smart Chain (BSC) daily block count = 28,800
APX Rewards per block = 2.7
APR
 = (28,800*2.7*Price of APX) / (Total ALP staked * Price of ALP) * 365
Both the price of APX & ALP will be based on the real time market price and the total number of ALP staked as shown on the platform is based on the real time figure.
Annual percentage yield (APY) = (1+APR/365)^(365)-1


For instance:
When the market price of APX is 0.03 USDT, total ALP staked is 1,000,000 USDT, the APR of ALP will be (28,800*2.7* 0.03)/(1,000,000*1)*365=85.15% and the APY will be APY=(1+110.38%/365)^(365)-1=134.08%
