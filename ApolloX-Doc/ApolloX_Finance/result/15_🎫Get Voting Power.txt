Get Voting Power
Overview: 
veNFT (vote-escrow NFT) will be the vesting and revenue model of ApolloX DAO.
Note: Users can obtain veNFT by staking in ApolloX DAO. veNFT is non-transferable and its power linearly depreciates with time. The power is a proof of the userâ€™s governance vote as well as dividend weight.
 
How to participate
Step 1: Go to [Lock & get veNFT] page
DAO APY: userâ€™s annualized percentage yield will be calculated based on a 7 days cycle.
Your lock-up quantity: accumulated amount of locked APX.
Your power: the sum of the power obtained by userâ€™s total locked APX 
Your veNFT: the quantity of veNFT 
Step 2: Click [Create new Vault], as shown in the following screenshot:
Details of parameters:
Locked quantity: Users can input the amount of APX to be locked
Locked period: Users can choose to lock APX for 60 days, 180 days, 1 year or 4 years. 
The lock-up time will be calculated from every Thursday. Users may see a reduction of 1 to 5 days on the actual lock-up time display on the right panel.
Voting power: The voting power value is determined by the locked period, locked quantity and the expiry time. Click

 to check out the formula for calculating power value.
Unlock time: Based on current veNFT unlock time, the userâ€™s power value will linearly depreciate as the unlock time shortens.
Note: Once users click to lock, the process cannot be terminated halfway. Please choose the locked period carefully.
