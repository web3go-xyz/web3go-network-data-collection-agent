Furnace
The Furnace is used to predict the rise and fall in ETH price levels by placing rAPX into the Furnace. Users who predict correctly will receive refined APX as a reward.
How to play
The game restarts every 5 minutes. During this period, players predict the movement in ETH price levels. Winners will receive APX minted from the rAPX. 
ETH prices
Price feeds will be obtained using the Chainlink oracle, refreshed every 90 seconds. Each time the furnace game cycle ends, the nearest price will be used for settlement.

Participation fees
5% of the rAPX received by the winner will be burnt (this includes the original deposit placed). 
Exceptional cases
If the outcome is a draw, 5% of the rAPX will be deducted as the participation fee and the remaining rAPX will be minted into APX. These will then be distributed accordingly to the players.
If everyone makes the same prediction (i.e. no one has predicted the opposite), 5% of the rAPX will be deducted as the participation fee and the remaining rAPX will be minted into APX. These will then be distributed accordingly to the players. 
If the game pauses or cannot be completed due to an accident, 5% of the rAPX will be deducted as the participation fee and the remaining rAPX will be minted into APX. These will then be distributed accordingly to the players.
