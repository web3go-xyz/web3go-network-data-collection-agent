Order Types
Market order: A market order is a buy or sell order that gets filled right away at the best price currently available on the market.
Limit order: A limit order lets you place an order at a specific price or a more favorable price. However, there's no guarantee that a limit order will be filled.
Limit buy orders are executed if the price of the asset hits the limit price or falls below that price.
Limit sell orders are executed if the price of the asset hits the limit price or rises above that price.
Do note that the opening fee and execution fee will be charged when a position is opened and this will be factored into the leverage amount.
