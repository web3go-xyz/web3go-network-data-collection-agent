Coin trend prediction
Each spaceship has its own coin attribute. Simply put, this coin attribute represents your prediction for the price movement during exploration.
Successful predictions boost exploration output. However, if you predict incorrectly, your output will decrease. Each successful prediction will also award points, with high scorers on the weekly, monthly, and quarterly Leaderboard receiving prizes.
The total output increase/decrease will be affected by the exploration time and the extent of the rise/fall in the coin price.
