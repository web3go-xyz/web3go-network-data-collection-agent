How to trade APX token on DEX
[For Deposits into Futures Wallet]
Step 1: 
Connect wallet 
& select [
Deposit
] to deposit APX or other crypto into ApolloX.
​
​
Step 2: Select your token and deposit your desired amount.
[For Deposits into Spot Wallet]
Alternatively, you can navigate to the Spot page to deposit funds directly into your spot wallet. Select [Assets] then [Deposit]. Deposit your funds to 
Spot. 
 
*If you only want to trade spot on ApolloX DEX, be careful not to deposit into 
Futures
 
as there is no transfer function from your Futures wallet to Spot wallet yet. You would have to manually transfer APX from your Futures wallet to your decentralized wallet, then redeposit APX to your Spot wallet. This will cause a 1% burn tax for each transfer of APX.
Deposit_USDT_EN.png
Confirm the transfer in your wallet.

​
Step 3: Once your funds have been deposited, you can start buying or selling APX/USDT or other trading pairs.

How to use Multi-Assets Mode
Multi-Assets Mode
Multi-Assets model expands the margin types of USDⓈ-M Futures, allowing users to trade across multiple margin assets. With Multi-Assets Mode, the profit and loss between USDT and BUSD margin asset positions offset each other, thereby increasing the capital efficiency. This Multi-Assets Mode only supports cross-margin mode.
 
Switch between Single/Multi-Assets Mode
On Website:
On the trading page, go to [Preference]-[Asset Mode] and select [Multi-Assets Mode].
Screenshot_2021-12-08_at_10.37.14_AM.png
Or you can click on the [Multi-Assets] button under "Margin Ratio" .
Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_6.03.00_PM.png
On App:
 Under Futures interface, go to [Features]-[Preferences]-[Assets Mode] and select [Multi-Assets Mode].

Wea-2021-12-08-122451.png
Wea-2021-12-08-122815.png
Please Note:
The Single-Asset Mode will be enabled by default and users will have to enable Multi-Assets Mode manually.
If there are open positions or open orders in USDⓈ-M Futures, Multi-Assets Mode cannot be activated.
If you are holding positions in Isolated Mode, please switch all open positions to Cross Margin Mode before enabling the Multi-Assets Mode.
 
Benefits of Multi-Assets Mode: 
Diversification: Users can diversify across various stable coins and increase their capital efficiency by using the Multi-Assets mode. 
Capital Efficiency: The shared margin feature allows traders to arbitrage between the two markets without the need to maintain multiple accounts or margins. Traders would simply deposit margin either in USDT or BUSD in their wallets and can use the same margin asset to open positions in different markets. 
Automatic exchange mechanism
Under the Multi-Assets Mode, when the balance of the asset account is less than the established automatic exchange threshold, other remaining assets under USDⓈ-M Futures wallet will be automatically exchanged into deficit asset currencies. The automatic exchange mechanism is handled by the matching engine. There is no commission charge for this automatic exchange service.
When your wallet balance is negative, if the loss is less than 10,000 USDT/BUSD, it will not be automatically exchanged; if the loss amount is greater than 10,000 USDT/BUSD, it will be exchanged in proportion to the USDⓈ-M Futures wallet asset balance, deducting your corresponding margin assets. 
This automatic exchange mechanism will help users balance their accounts and increase the capital utilisation. With the Multi-Assets Mode, users now can diversify their stable coin exposure between BUSD and USDT.

Section: 12_3_Spaceship Attributes
Spaceship Attributes
Mining Power (MP)
MP ranges from 30 to 100. Its value will affect the mining rate during exploration. The higher the MP, the higher the mining rate, and the more {Sub-Token} you can mine.
Basic Mining Rate (MAX 100%) = (MP - Difficulty / 100) ^ 1.5 / (Difficulty / 10) ^ 1.5
Mining Rate = Basic Mining Rate x (0.8-1.2) 
Output = Mining Rate x Available Mining Capacity 
Exploration Power (EP) 
EP ranges from 30 to 100. Its value will affect the odds of discovering rare planets and the number of planets that can be explored. The higher the EP, the greater probability of discovering a rare planet, and the more planets you can explore. These will translate to a higher output. Rare galaxies will also require players to have a certain EP level.
Rare Planet Odds = (EP ^ 1.5 - 100) / (Difficulty / 10) x Galaxy Boost 
Exploration Success Rate 
Players can explore a maximum of 5 planets each time. The success rate for the first planet is 100%, and will decrease incrementally with each subsequent planet.
During the exploration time, the spaceship will continue to search for the next planet. If the exploration ends without discovering another planet, it means that no further planets were discovered. For instance, if the player sets out to explore 5 planets but discovers only 3 planets by the end of the exploration time, the 4th and 5th planets were not discovered. So in this example, the total number of planets explored in the game was 3.

EP%*2 - 80%

Durability
The spaceship Durability is set at 600. Each time after exploring, the spaceship will lose Durability. Once this reaches zero, the spaceship can no longer be used. You can pay APX to repair the spaceship, which will return the Durability to 600.
Repaired
Each spaceship can be repaired a maximum of 5 times, and the success rate will decrease incrementally. If the repair fails, the spaceship will not disappear but the Durability will remain at 0.

Coin Attribute
Each spaceship has its own coin attribute (eg. BTC UP), which is used to predict the coin trend during exploration. If the prediction is successful, the output will be boosted.

Coin trend prediction
Each spaceship has its own coin attribute. Simply put, this coin attribute represents your prediction for the price movement during exploration.
Successful predictions boost exploration output. However, if you predict incorrectly, your output will decrease. Each successful prediction will also award points, with high scorers on the weekly, monthly, and quarterly Leaderboard receiving prizes.
The total output increase/decrease will be affected by the exploration time and the extent of the rise/fall in the coin price.

Players explore galaxies on their spaceships in search of rare planets to mine. In return, they can receive rAPX as rewards. While exploring, players also stand to win attractive prizes.
How to Start
Select galaxy
To start exploring, players need to select a galaxy. Rarer galaxies contain rarer planets that can be discovered. Of course, the EP required to explore these galaxies will also be higher.
Rare Planet Odds = (EP ^ 1.5 - 100) / (Difficulty / 10) x Galaxy Boost

Select your spaceship
You can select a spaceship to predict coin trends. If the coin attribute matches the market price movements during the exploration time, your rewards will be boosted. Successful predictions will also win points that count towards the Leaderboard, where top players get to split the prize pool.
Select the number of planets to explore 
Select the number of planets and pay the corresponding 
Fuel Fee
. This does not mean you will get to explore the number selected, as you may be limited by your EP. For instance, you may have spent 
Fuel Fees
 for 5 planets but your EP only allows you to explore 1.
Exploration success rate 
Players can explore a maximum of 5 planets each time. The success rate for the first planet is 100%, and will decrease incrementally with each subsequent planet.
During the exploration time, the spaceship will continue to search for the next planet. If the exploration ends without discovering another planet, it means that there are no further planets discovered. For instance, if the player sets out to explore 5 planets but only discovers 3 planets by the end of the exploration time, the 4th and 5th planets were not discovered successfully. The total number of planets explored in the game is 3. ​

​Introduction to Coin Trend Prediction ​
​
Auxiliary Ship
The Auxiliary Ship is primarily used to assist mining. The number of rAPX mined will be multiplied by the number of Auxiliary Ships utilized during exploration. Hence, the more Auxiliary Ships you have during exploration, the more rAPX you will receive accordingly. For instance, if you were originally able to mine 10 rAPX and you have 15 Auxiliary Ships, you will be able to mine 150 rAPX.
However, the more Auxiliary Ships you utilize, the higher the 
fuel fees
 you will incur.
Exploration cycle 
Each spaceship can only be used once a day for exploration. This will be refreshed daily at 12:00 UTC.
During Exploration 
Mining planets 
After discovering a planet, players can start mining. Each planet will have its own available mining capacity. The rarer the planet, the greater the capacity. Players should not expect to mine 100% capacity each time as the output depends on the Mining Rate, which is determined by the MP and Difficulty. The higher the MP, the easier the mining. The higher the Difficulty, the more challenging it will be to mine.
Basic Mining Rate (MAX 100%) = (MP - Difficulty / 100) ^ 1.5 / (Difficulty / 10) ^ 1.5
Mining Rate = Basic Mining Rate x (0.8-1.2)

Section: 12_6_Furnace
Furnace
The Furnace is used to predict the rise and fall in ETH price levels by placing rAPX into the Furnace. Users who predict correctly will receive refined APX as a reward.
How to play
The game restarts every 5 minutes. During this period, players predict the movement in ETH price levels. Winners will receive APX minted from the rAPX. 
ETH prices
Price feeds will be obtained using the Chainlink oracle, refreshed every 90 seconds. Each time the furnace game cycle ends, the nearest price will be used for settlement.
Contract address: 0x9ef1b8c0e4f7dc8bf5719ea496883dc6401d5b2e 
Participation fees
5% of the rAPX received by the winner will be burnt (this includes the original deposit placed). 
Exceptional cases
If the outcome is a draw, 5% of the rAPX will be deducted as the participation fee and the remaining rAPX will be minted into APX. These will then be distributed accordingly to the players.
If everyone makes the same prediction (i.e. no one has predicted the opposite), 5% of the rAPX will be deducted as the participation fee and the remaining rAPX will be minted into APX. These will then be distributed accordingly to the players. 
If the game pauses or cannot be completed due to an accident, 5% of the rAPX will be deducted as the participation fee and the remaining rAPX will be minted into APX. These will then be distributed accordingly to the players. 
Claim rewards 
The rewards can be claimed on the Furnace History page. No additional fees will be charged.

👨🚀
How To Participate?
Step 1: Click [Connect Wallet] to login into the ApolloX DEX platform.
 
Step 2: Click [APX DAO] under [Governance] to access the page. The homepage will display the total locked supply, average locked period, total power and veNFT supply. 
Total Locked Supply: the total amount of APX staked by users participating in DAO Governance.
Average Locked Period: the average locked time of users participating in DAO Governance, which is equal to the sum of the locked time of all users divided by the total number of users.
Total Power: the sum of the power of all users currently participating in DAO Governance.
veNFT Supply: the amount of veNFT issued by the system.
 
Step 3: Click [Lock & get veNFT] to stake and enjoy multiple benefits. The amount of APX distributed by the current DAO's revenue dividends and Trading Rewards Program will also be displayed.
Staking Rewards
Users can obtain veNFT by staking APX in ApolloX DAO. The power is a proof of the user’s governance vote as well as dividend weight. ApolloX will withdraw 50,000 APX from income everyday to reward users.
 
Repurchase Rewards 
ApolloX will set aside a portion of trading fee income every day, used to repurchase APX from the secondary market from time to time. The repurchased APX will be added into the DAO reward pool.

Get Voting Power
Overview: 
veNFT (vote-escrow NFT) will be the vesting and revenue model of ApolloX DAO.
Note: Users can obtain veNFT by staking in ApolloX DAO. veNFT is non-transferable and its power linearly depreciates with time. The power is a proof of the user’s governance vote as well as dividend weight.
 
How to participate
Step 1: Go to [Lock & get veNFT] page
DAO APY: user’s annualized percentage yield will be calculated based on a 7 days cycle.
Your lock-up quantity: accumulated amount of locked APX.
Your power: the sum of the power obtained by user’s total locked APX 
Your veNFT: the quantity of veNFT 
Step 2: Click [Create new Vault], as shown in the following screenshot:
Details of parameters:
Locked quantity: Users can input the amount of APX to be locked
Locked period: Users can choose to lock APX for 60 days, 180 days, 1 year or 4 years. 
The lock-up time will be calculated from every Thursday. Users may see a reduction of 1 to 5 days on the actual lock-up time display on the right panel.
Voting power: The voting power value is determined by the locked period, locked quantity and the expiry time. Click 
here
 to check out the formula for calculating power value.
Unlock time: Based on current veNFT unlock time, the user’s power value will linearly depreciate as the unlock time shortens.
Note: Once users click to lock, the process cannot be terminated halfway. Please choose the locked period carefully.
 
Step 3: manage your veNFT as shown:

Update lock-up information
Users can update lock-up information here, including locked quantity and locked period
 
Once created, users can [manage] your cards and [claim] your rewards here.
Details for claiming DAO rewards:
Users will receive rewards of the previous cycle on the last day of the next cycle.
When veNFT expires, users will need to claim the rewards first before unlocking the locked tokens.
Expired veNFT will be destroyed.

Section: 18_🖱Create API
🖱
Create API
API is an acronym for Application Programming Interface. With API, data can be pulled from ApolloX and interacted with external applications. You can view your wallet and transaction data, or trades in third-party programs.
1. Go to [API Management] and click [Create API].
2. Key in and set your preferred label name of the API which you would like to create and click [Create API].
3. After creating, you will get the API keyand Secret Key for that API. You can click on the “copy” icon to copy and record it to somewhere secure.
Note: 
For security reasons, Secret Keys are only visible at the time the API Key is created. Any time after that point, it will be masked. Please copy and record down securely. If you forget your Secret Key, you will need to delete the API and create a new one. 
Do not disclose your API Key or Secret Key to anyone to avoid any losses.
You are also recommended to bind IP for API Key to increase your account security.
4. You can view and manage the list of APIs that you have created on API Management. Each account can create up to 30 API Keys.

Section: 19_💾API Documentation
💾
API Documentation
General Info
General API Information
Some endpoints will require an API Key. Please refer to 
this page
​
The base endpoint is: 
https://fapi.apollox.finance
All endpoints return either a JSON object or array.
Data is returned in 
ascending
 order. Oldest first, newest last.
All time and timestamp related fields are in milliseconds.
All data types adopt definition in JAVA.
HTTP Return Codes
HTTP 
4XX
 return codes are used for for malformed requests; the issue is on the sender's side.
HTTP 
403
 return code is used when the WAF Limit (Web Application Firewall) has been violated.
HTTP 
429
 return code is used when breaking a request rate limit.
HTTP 
418
 return code is used when an IP has been auto-banned for continuing to send requests after receiving 
429
 codes.
HTTP 
5XX
 return codes are used for internal errors; the issue is on ApolloX's side.
HTTP 
503
 return code is used when the API successfully sent the message but not get a response within the timeout period.
It is important to 
NOT
 treat this as a failure operation; the execution status is 
UNKNOWN
 and could have been a success.
Error Codes and Messages
Any endpoint can return an ERROR
The error payload is as follows:
{
 
"code"
:
 
-
1121
,
 
"msg"
:
 
"Invalid symbol."
}
Specific error codes and messages defined in Error Codes.
General Information on Endpoints
For 
GET
 endpoints, parameters must be sent as a 
query string
.
For 
POST
, 
PUT
, and 
DELETE
 endpoints, the parameters may be sent as a 
query string
 or in the 
request body
 with content type 
application/x-www-form-urlencoded
. You may mix parameters between both the 
query string
 and 
request body
 if you wish to do so.
Parameters may be sent in any order.
If a parameter sent in both the 
query string
 and 
request body
, the 
query string
 parameter will be used.
LIMITS
The 
/fapi/v1/exchangeInfo
 
rateLimits
 array contains objects related to the exchange's 
RAW_REQUEST
, 
REQUEST_WEIGHT
, and 
ORDER
 rate limits. These are further defined in the 
ENUM definitions
 section under 
Rate limiters (rateLimitType)
.
A 
429
 will be returned when either rate limit is violated.
ApolloX Finance has the right to further tighten the rate limits on users with intent to attack.
IP Limits
Every request will contain 
X-MBX-USED-WEIGHT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter)
 in the response headers which has the current used weight for the IP for all request rate limiters defined.
Each route has a 
weight
 which determines for the number of requests each endpoint counts for. Heavier endpoints and endpoints that do operations on multiple symbols will have a heavier 
weight
.
When a 429 is received, it's your obligation as an API to back off and not spam the API.
Repeatedly violating rate limits and/or failing to back off after receiving 429s will result in an automated IP ban (HTTP status 418).
IP bans are tracked and 
scale in duration
 for repeat offenders, 
from 2 minutes to 3 days
.
The limits on the API are based on the IPs, not the API keys.
It is strongly recommended to use websocket stream for getting data as much as possible, which can not only ensure the timeliness of the message, but also reduce the access restriction pressure caused by the request.
Order Rate Limits
Every order response will contain a 
X-MBX-ORDER-COUNT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter)
 header which has the current order count for the account for all order rate limiters defined.
Rejected/unsuccessful orders are not guaranteed to have 
X-MBX-ORDER-COUNT-**
 headers in the response.
The order rate limit is counted against each account
.
Endpoint Security Type
Each endpoint has a security type that determines the how you will interact with it.
API-keys are passed into the Rest API via the 
X-MBX-APIKEY
 header.
API-keys and secret-keys 
are case sensitive
.
API-keys can be configured to only access certain types of secure endpoints. For example, one API-key could be used for TRADE only, while another API-key can access everything except for TRADE routes.
By default, API-keys can access all secure routes.
Security Type
Description
NONE
Endpoint can be accessed freely.
TRADE
Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key and signature.
USER_DATA
Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key and signature.
USER_STREAM
Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key.
MARKET_DATA
Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key.
TRADE
 and 
USER_DATA
 endpoints are 
SIGNED
 endpoints.
SIGNED (TRADE and USER_DATA) Endpoint Security
SIGNED
 endpoints require an additional parameter, 
signature
, to be sent in the 
query string
 or 
request body
.
Endpoints use 
HMAC SHA256
 signatures. The 
HMAC SHA256 signature
 is a keyed 
HMAC SHA256
 operation. Use your 
secretKey
 as the key and 
totalParams
 as the value for the HMAC operation.
The 
signature
 is 
not case sensitive
.
Please make sure the 
signature
 is the end part of your 
query string
 or 
request body
.
totalParams
 is defined as the 
query string
 concatenated with the 
request body
.
Timing Security
A 
SIGNED
 endpoint also requires a parameter, 
timestamp
, to be sent which should be the millisecond timestamp of when the request was created and sent.
An additional parameter, 
recvWindow
, may be sent to specify the number of milliseconds after 
timestamp
 the request is valid for. If 
recvWindow
 is not sent, 
it defaults to 5000
.
The logic is as follows:
 
if
 
(
timestamp 
<
 
(
serverTime 
+
 
1000
)
 
&&
 
(
serverTime 
-
 timestamp
)
 
<=
 recvWindow
){
 
// process request
 
}
 
 
else
 
{
 
// reject request
 
}
Serious trading is about timing.
 Networks can be unstable and unreliable, which can lead to requests taking varying amounts of time to reach the servers. With 
recvWindow
, you can specify that the request must be processed within a certain number of milliseconds or be rejected by the server.
It is recommended to use a small recvWindow of 5000 or less!

maxPrice
 defines the maximum 
price
/
stopPrice
 allowed; disabled on 
maxPrice
 == 0.
tickSize
 defines the intervals that a 
price
/
stopPrice
 can be increased/decreased by; disabled on 
tickSize
 == 0.
Any of the above variables can be set to 0, which disables that rule in the 
price filter
. In order to pass the 
price filter
, the following must be true for 
price
/
stopPrice
 of the enabled rules:
price
 >= 
minPrice
price

MAX_NUM_ORDERS
/exchangeInfo format:
 
{
 
"filterType"
:
 
"MAX_NUM_ORDERS"
,
 
"limit"
:
 
200
 
}
The 
MAX_NUM_ORDERS
 filter defines the maximum number of orders an account is allowed to have open on a symbol.
Note that both "algo" orders and normal orders are counted for this filter.
MAX_NUM_ALGO_ORDERS
/exchangeInfo format:
 
{
 
"filterType"
:
 
"MAX_NUM_ALGO_ORDERS"
,
 
"limit"

MIN_NOTIONAL
/exchangeInfo format:
 
{
 
"filterType"
:
 
"MIN_NOTIONAL"
,
 
"notional"
:
 
"1"
 
}
The

Websocket Market Streams
The baseurl for websocket is 
wss://fstream.apollox.finance
Streams can be access either in a single raw stream or a combined stream
Raw streams are accessed at 
/ws/<streamName>
Combined streams are accessed at 
/stream?streams=<streamName1>/<streamName2>/<streamName3>
Combined stream events are wrapped as follows: 
{"stream":"<streamName>","data":<rawPayload>}
All symbols for streams are 
lowercase
A single connection is only valid for 24 hours; expect to be disconnected at the 24 hour mark
The websocket server will send a 
ping frame
 every 5 minutes. If the websocket server does not receive a 
pong frame
 back from the connection within a 15 minute period, the connection will be disconnected. Unsolicited 
pong frames
 are allowed.
WebSocket connections have a limit of 10 incoming messages per second.
A connection that goes beyond the limit will be disconnected; IPs that are repeatedly disconnected may be banned.
A single connection can listen to a maximum of 
200
 streams.
Considering the possible data latency from RESTful endpoints during an extremely volatile market, it is highly recommended to get the order status, position, etc from the Websocket user data stream.
Live Subscribing/Unsubscribing to streams
The following data can be sent through the websocket instance in order to subscribe/unsubscribe from streams. Examples can be seen below.
The 
id
 used in the JSON payloads is an unsigned INT used as an identifier to uniquely identify the messages going back and forth.

How to manage a local order book correctly
1.
Open a stream to 
wss://fstream.apollox.finance/
[email protected]
.
2.
Buffer the events you receive from the stream. For same price, latest received update covers the previous one.
3.
Get a depth snapshot from 
https://fapi.apollox.finance/fapi/v1/depth?symbol=BTCUSDT&limit=1000
 .
4.
Drop any event where 
u
 is < 
lastUpdateId
 in the snapshot.
5.
The first processed event should have 
U
 <= 
lastUpdateId
 
AND
 
u
 >= 
lastUpdateId
6.
While listening to the stream, each new event's 
pu
 should be equal to the previous event's 
u
, otherwise initialize the process from step 3.
7.
The data in each event is the 
absolute
 quantity for a price level.
8.
If the quantity is 0, 
remove
 the price level.
9.
Receiving an event that removes a price level that is not in your local order book can happen and is normal.
Account/Trades Endpoints
Considering the possible data latency from RESTful endpoints during an extremely volatile market, it is highly recommended to get the order status, position, etc from the Websocket user data stream.

The endpoint should be called repeatedly as heartbeats so that the existing countdown time can be canceled and replaced by a new one.
Example usage:
Call this endpoint at 30s intervals with an countdownTime of 120000 (120s).
If this endpoint is not called within 120 seconds, all your orders of the specified symbol will be automatically canceled.
If this endpoint is called with an countdownTime of 0, the countdown timer will be stopped.
The system will check all countdowns 
approximately every 10 milliseconds
, so please note that sufficient redundancy should be considered when using this function. We do not recommend setting the countdown time to be too precise or too small.

What is ApolloX Finance?
ApolloX is the leading decentralized solution shaping Web3 trading, consisting of decentralized crypto derivatives exchange ApolloX DEX and bespoke derivatives trading solution ApolloX DEX Engine.
Introduction
ApolloX Finance is a decentralized derivatives trading protocol. Users can enjoy a smooth trading experience while connecting to ApolloX with just one click through their decentralized wallets. ApolloX trading version 1 (V1) launched in 2021 offering order book perpetuals. As of April 2023, ApolloX has deployed its trading version 2 (V2) on the BSC mainnet, moving perpetual trading fully on chain to bring more transparency and decentralization, boosting the derivatives ecosystem. 
Architecture and Implementation
V1 Order Book Futures
Unlike the common Automated Market Makers model (AMM) which is adopted by other decentralized exchanges, ApolloX V1 adopts the order book model, which supports futures trading. 
Through an "off-chain transaction matching + on-chain fund settlement and custody" model, ApolloX Finance achieves high transaction performance and fast response speeds while ensuring the safety and transparency of users’ funds. Users connect their decentralized wallets to the exchange before signing and verifying the connection through a Web3 interface. They can then transfer (ERC-20/BEP-20) tokens into the smart contract for fund custody and settlement. Once the off-chain ledger is recorded, users can use the funds to trade derivatives off-chain and the PnL will be accounted for in the ledger. After settlement, users can withdraw the funds by calling the smart contract (except for the margin occupied by open positions and pending orders).
By using off-chain order books and on-chain settlement, we aim to create an efficient, fair and trustless financial market that is not controlled by any centralized organization.
V2 Full On Chain Transparency
The main architecture of ApolloX V2 is the fully on-chain liquidity model for more transparent, low slippage trades. Users do not need to register, deposit or withdraw funds. All V2 trades are executed against the ALP pool on BNB Smart Chain and liquidity for all V2 trading pairs is shared via the ALP pool to maximize capital efficiency. Real time price feeds will be taken from both Binance Oracle and Chainlink to ensure the most accurate pricing.

2021-2022 Roadmap
ApolloX launched in 2021 as the first hybrid CEX & DEX solution for crypto derivatives. Since then, it has grown by leaps and bounds.
Roadmap
Recap: Key Milestones
In Q4 2021, ApolloX launched its DEX and became the first hybrid CEX & DEX solution for crypto derivatives. 24h trading volume hit US$518,000,000, cementing ApolloX’s position in the top 5 DEXes, according to CoinMarketCap data.
ApolloX’s native utility and governance token first listed on crypto exchange PancakeSwap with a listing price of $0.0004, in December 2021. In the same month, ApolloX introduced its Trading Rewards Program and recruited its first batch of ApolloX Champs — ApolloX community volunteers.
To further make blockchain and crypto accessible to everyone, ApolloX integrated a fiat on-ramp solution in Q1 2022 supporting over 20 fiat currencies. It also launched the ApolloX DeFi Wallet in the ApolloX Mobile App.
In March 2022, ApolloX launched a series of major product updates. It opened spot trading on its CEX and partnered with leading DEX PancakeSwap to offer perpetual trading to PancakeSwap’s user base. To build its multi-chain ecosystem, ApolloX also added ERC20 network support.
ApolloX extended its perpetual trading partnership to BabySwap and Leonicorn Swap in Q1-Q2 2022. The number of APX holders grew to over 30,000 and ApolloX now has 8 local Telegram communities managed by ApolloX Champs. More importantly, ApolloX unveiled its ApolloX 2.0 plan, which included a 5.7 billion APX token burn and its transition to DAO governance.
What to Expect
In 2022, the team will further grow the ApolloX ecosystem to provide value to more crypto traders and expand the ApolloX brand.
Expect limit take profit/stop loss orders for convenient in-app trading, spot trading on DEX, DEX As A Service (DAAS) and ApolloX DAO — to name a few — in the upcoming months*.
*Roadmap may be subject to change.

*May be subject to change depending on development priorities and market changes.
Product
ALP Perpetual Trading v2
: ALP perpetual contracts (ALP-PERP) on ApolloX currently employ off-chain settlement. To uphold our commitment to decentralized trading, ALP-PERP will go fully on-chain in Q2 2023, joining the already on-chain ALP staking pool. A testnet will be launched before mainnet to resolve any bugs and improve the trading experience.
Expand Multichain Ecosystem
: For the convenience of traders and investors who participate in multiple DeFi ecosystems, ApolloX committed to building a multi-chain ecosystem, starting from its launch on BNB Chain. In 2022, ApolloX integrated with Ethereum and Arbitrum Networks. In 2023, we will continue to add support for promising and in-demand chains.
DAO & APX Token 
DAO Proposal Creation Opens to Members
: ApolloX DAO has passed more than 10 governance proposals since its inception. In 2023, DAO proposal creation will open to all DAO members to encourage active contribution, and further improve on ApolloX’s degree of decentralization.
Burn Repurchased APX
: Currently, ApolloX uses 50% of daily platform fee income to repurchase APX from secondary markets. Repurchased APX is added to the DAO staking rewards pool and distributed to APX stakers. To further reduce the circulating supply of APX tokens, ApolloX DAO will hold a governance vote in Q2/Q3 2023 to burn these repurchased APX instead. 
Others
ApolloXplore
: Put on hold after shifts in development priorities in 2022, the ApolloXplore game will open pre-sales to all previously whitelisted ApolloX users this year. A fun and interactive prediction game, ApolloXplore players will board spaceships to explore different galaxies and find planets where they can mine raw APX (rAPX) to mint APX tokens, while predicting the price of certain cryptocurrencies concurrently.
NFT Lottery Game 2.0
: The ApolloX NFT Lottery Game 1.0 saw 5 successful rounds of the game where players created unique, customizable NFTs and earned rewards. In 2023, we would like to bring ApolloXplore back with better and improved game rules, for more fun and rewards!

Section: 3_2_4_1_TP_SL orders (Strategy Order)
TP/SL orders (Strategy Order)
When placing a Limit Order, you will be able to set the [Take Profit] and [Stop Loss] orders simultaneously.
 
Click [Limit] and enter the order price and size. Then, check the box next to [TP/SL] to set the [Take Profit] and [Stop Loss] prices based on the [Last Price] or [Mark Price]. Next, click [Buy/Long] or [Sell/Short] to place the order.
 
*You can only select either [TP/SL] or have enabled [Reduce-only] in a single order.
 
Please note that if you are using the [Hedge mode] , the [TP/SL] function is only available for [Open] orders.
 
You can check your orders under the [Open Orders] tab and Click [View] under [TP/SL] to view order details.
 
When an order is triggered, you can add or modify the TP/SL under the [Positions] tab. This will be applied to the entire position.
 
Currently, excluding Trailing Stop Order, only Limit, Market, Stop Limit, Stop Market, and Post Only Orders are supported under the [TP/SL] function.
 
These orders are executed through the strategy order. ApolloX supports One-Triggers-a-One-Cancels-the-Other (OTOCO). 
 
In an OTOCO order, if the primary order is filled or partially filled, the secondary order will take effect (either Take Profit or Stop Loss). If TP is filled, SL will be canceled, and vice versa. This is also called an OTO order.
 
Note: If the trigger price of the secondary order is too close to the primary order, it is highly likely that the secondary order will be canceled when the primary order is executed. We recommend users to set an ample price distance between the primary and secondary orders.
 
Users can set multiple Take Profit and Stop Loss orders for each of their Long or Short positions. Note that the Take Profit and Stop Loss orders will be executed in the order that they were placed until the cumulative size of these orders meets the same size of the primary Long or Short position. You can click [View] under [TP/SL] on the primary order to view unfulfilled TP/SL.
 
Advanced TP/SL
We have launched the advanced TP/SL function recently, when you place the order and enter the percentage，you will get the【Taker profit】and【Stop loss】price automatically. You need to enable the advanced TP/SL first in settings as below:
 
Then you could choose the trigger condition between mark price and last price, enter your preferred percentage, then place the order：
 
You could select between limit TP/SL order and Market TP/SL order. Please note, the stop loss /take profit price will update automatically if you do not place the order immediately.

Closing Positions
Calculating profit and loss (PnL) using the last price:
PnL for open positions is currently calculated based on the contract’s last price. This makes it easier to manage your trades based on current market conditions.
1. How do I calculate PnL using the last price?
On the Futures Trading page, scroll down to the Positions panel and click on 
[PNL (ROE %]
 to select your preferred price basis (i.e., mark price or last price)
Select 
[Last Price]
 to calculate PnL based on the contract's last price. The PnL(ROE%) of all of your open positions will be calculated using the selected method.
 
​
Using the Close All Positions function:
In the event of extreme market conditions, you can use the Close All Positions function to exit all of your open positions at once rather than having to exit multiple positions manually. Just click the [
Close All Positions
] button to exit all of your positions.
1. How do I use the Close All Positions function?
On the Futures Trading page, scroll down and click on the Position Preferences icon. Check the box next to [
Close All Positions
] to enable this feature. Once enabled, you'll be able to click the 
[Close All Positions]
 button to close your positions at market price.
Note:
Once this function is enabled and you click [
Close All Positions
], the system will cancel all of your open orders and close all of your open positions at once using market orders.
During extreme market conditions, unrealized PnL may differ from realized PnL due to volatility, slippage, and execution risks.

Please Note:
User may sell their ALP 48 hours from the time of buying
Amount of ALP tokens that can be sold: min[(Value of the liquidity pool - Value of user’s positions)*50%]/ALP Market Price. For instance, the value of the liquidity pool is 10,000,000 USDT, the value of the user's position is 5,000,000 USDT and ALP Market Price is 2 USDT, the maximum amount the ALP user can sell is 1,250,000. 
At the same time, the amount of USDC or ETH or USDT that users receive after selling their ALP tokens cannot exceed the ALP liquidity pool. For instance, if the liquidity pool only has 1000 USDT, the maximum amount of USDT users receive will be 1000 USDT and the remaining ALPs can be sold for other cryptocurrencies.

Rewards Distribution Rules
ALP Staking Rewards Formula


Annual Percentage Rate (APR)
 = [(Number of blocks produced by Binance Smart Chain (BSC) per day * Number of APX rewards per block * Price of APX) / (Total number of ALP staked * Price of ALP)] * 365
Binance Smart Chain (BSC) daily block count = 28,800
APX Rewards per block = 2.7
APR
 = (28,800*2.7*Price of APX) / (Total ALP staked * Price of ALP) * 365
Both the price of APX & ALP will be based on the real time market price and the total number of ALP staked as shown on the platform is based on the real time figure.
Annual percentage yield (APY) = (1+APR/365)^(365)-1


For instance:
When the market price of APX is 0.03 USDT, total ALP staked is 1,000,000 USDT, the APR of ALP will be (28,800*2.7* 0.03)/(1,000,000*1)*365=85.15% and the APY will be APY=(1+110.38%/365)^(365)-1=134.08%

Opening a position
Users can choose to "Buy/Long" or "Sell/Short" to open their positions with leverage.
Long position: If the price rises, you will earn a profit. If price falls, you will make a loss.
Short position: If the price falls, you will earn a profit. If price rises, you will make a loss.
​
Reminder: When users trade ALP-PERP contracts, they trade directly with the ALP liquidity pool. ALP-PERP does not use an order book and has low slippage. ALP-PERP contract price will be anchored using the current mark price and fixed slippage. (Fixed slippage is mainly used to deter price manipulation)
​
When the ALP liquidity pool is profitable, it drives up the price of ALP. The main sources of profit are derived from contract trading income, forced liquidation fees, etc.
​
Please note: The transaction volume contributed by the ALP contract will not be included in the trading rewards activity, however users may use APX as fee deduction.

Funding Rate

Copy link

Section: 5_5_8_💡Funding Rate
💡
Funding Rate
A Funding Rate is a periodic payment made to long or short traders based on the price difference between the market price of the perpetual contract and the spot price. When the market is bullish, the Funding Rate is positive and long traders pay a funding fee to traders who are short. Conversely, when the market is bearish, the funding rate is negative and short traders pay the funding fee to long traders.
ApolloX does not charge any fees for funding rate transfers, as funds are transferred directly between users. Funding fees on ApolloX are taken every 8 hours at 00:00 UTC, 08:00 UTC, and 16:00 UTC. Traders are only liable for funding payments in either direction if they have open positions at the predetermined funding times. Traders who do not have an open position will not pay or receive any funding.
Note: There is a 15-second deviation between the actual time and the time the funding fee is taken. For example, if you open a position at 16:00:05 UTC, you may still be charged a funding fee. Therefore, it is important that you pay attention to the exact time you open a position.
In order to maintain the stability of the market, ApolloX will calculate the funding rate for certain trading pairs based on the gap between long and short positions. Detailed calculation method as below:
abs(funding rate)=clamp{ floor,abs(Long OI - Short OI) * Interest Rate of hour / M,cap}
 IF Long OI> Short OI,Funding Rate=abs(funding rate)
IF Long OI< Short OI,Funding Rate=-abs(funding rate)
IF Long OI= Short OI,Funding Rate=0
Parameters:
Long IO is the total long positions value, Short OI is the total short positions value
Interest Rate of hour, the funding fee will be charged every two hours.
M is the maximum position size 
Effective date of trading pairs : All BUSD trading pairs (Updated on 9 February 2023)
​
Examples:
If the long position size is 100 BUSD, short position size is 200 BUSD, the limitations for both long and short position is 200 BUSD, then the net position of marker maker is +100 BUSD, interest rate will be 5%. According to the formula:
abs(funding rate)=claim{ 0.00001,100 * 0.05  / M,0.1}=0.025
IF Long OI< Short OI
Funding Rate =-abs(funding rate)=-2.5%


then, 
Short positions need to pay this funding fee： 200 *2.5%=5 BUSD
Long positions receive this funding fee：100* 2.5%=2.5 BUSD
Market maker of ALP pool receive this funding fee：100*2.5%=2.5 BUSD
​
If the long position size is 200 BUSD, short position size is 100 BUSD, the limitations for both long and short position is 200 BUSD, then the net position of market maker is -100 BUSD, interest rate is 5%. According to the formula:
abs(funding rate)=claim{ 0.00001,100 * 0.05  / M,0.1}=0.025
IF Long OI> Short OI
Funding Rate =-abs(funding rate)=2.5%
​
then, 
Long positions need to pay this funding fee： 200 *0.025=5 BUSD
Short positions will receive this funding fee：100*0.025=2.5 BUSD
Market maker of ALP pool receive this funding fee:  100*0.025=2.5 BUSD

How To Trade？
ApolloX ALP-PERP contracts trading differs from the usual contract model. The transaction price of ALP-PERP contracts is equivalent to the mark price plus platform slippage. That said, the first three ALP-PERP contracts BTCBUSD, ETHBUSD and BNBBUSD will have zero slippage trading, hence their mark price is the final transaction price. This model has a low transaction threshold and no order book, ensuring that users will be able to trade as close as possible to the mark price. Currently, users can only trade ALP-PERP in Lite mode. However, they will be able to close ALP-PERP positions in Classic mode under the ‘Positions’ section.

Section: 5_💎ApolloX Liquidity Pool
💎
ApolloX Liquidity Pool
ALP is the ApolloX platform’s liquidity provider token. Users can become liquidity providers by using any of the specified assets to buy ALP. Trading PnL is credited to ALP asset value, hence users can profit when ALP asset value increases. Users can also stake ALP to earn APX rewards.
The initial issue price of ALP is USD$1. Users who buy and stake ALP participate in ALP-PERP market making. The fluctuation of ALP price is correlated with the value of the liquidity pool and its trading PnL. Thus, the price of ALP changes accordingly with the profit or loss of the liquidity pool.
In future, ApolloX will support more utility of ALP on the platform such as earning transaction fee rewards, using ALP as margin for perpetual trading and participation in DAO governance and voting.
ALP contract address: 0x4E47057f45adF24ba41375a175dA0357cB3480E5
ALP represents a basket of tokens. The initial phase supports tokens USDC, USDT and ETH.
Note: After buying ALP, users cannot transfer it to other wallet addresses. Currently, only selling, staking and unstaking functions are supported.

Order book and market depth displays are removed. The ALP pool provides liquidity for all trading pairs to maximize capital efficiency. Users who mint ALP participate in the market-making of V2 perpetual contracts. The fluctuation in ALP token price is correlated with the value of the ALP pool and its profits and losses — PnL of the ALP pool will cause ALP price to rise or fall.

More Security 
Utilizing price feeds from both Binance Oracle and Chainlink helps avoid abnormal price behavior in the event of manipulation or lack of liquidity from the source platforms of either oracle. This mitigates the risk of unexpected liquidations on ApolloX.
​
Non-custodial platform 
As compared to centralized exchanges, DEX traders are the custodians of their own funds. They do not have to manually deposit and withdraw on the platform to trade. ApolloX DEX also does not have the ability to manage, increase or reduce users’ trading positions unless they are being liquidated due to market volatility.
​
Higher Liquidity 
Trading pairs on the platform share liquidity via the ALP pool. Hence, it is not required to separately add liquidity for each newly listed trading pair. Capital efficiency is maximized and users can open bigger position sizes.

Section: 6_3_🤝Powered by Binance Oracle and Chainlink
🤝
Powered by Binance Oracle and Chainlink
In the order book model, derivatives real-time price feed may not always be consistent with spot price feeds. In order to better prevent any risks that may arise from centralized oracle networks, ApolloX adopts a combination of Binance Oracle and Chainlink where price feeds from these two oracles are compared to deduce the most accurate real-time aggregated prices.


Using Binance Oracle's price as the anchor, if the price from Binance Oracle differs from Chainlink's price by more than 1%, a circuit breaker will be triggered and the user will not be able to complete the transaction.


All trading pairs on ApolloX platform use the oracle price of the listed assets as the index price. The platform does not generate its own prices nor does it charge any fees from users for this process.
​
Digital assets can experience large price fluctuations within a short period of time. As a DeFi derivatives platform, the platform must be able to access the latest market data instantly. This is especially so for on-chain trading. Binance Oracle has customized a low-latency solution exclusively for ApolloX, to avoid the risk of MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) and front-running transactions to protect on-chain derivatives transactions.
​
Explaining the ApolloX Oracle Architecture
1.
On-chain —— The user sends a transaction request and simultaneously triggers a request to obtain the latest price. 
2.
Off-chain —— Binance Oracle obtains the latest price request through Web3 monitoring and immediately updates the latest index-weighted average price feed.
3.
On-chain —— ApolloX smart contracts compare the price with Chainlink price feed to verify the accuracy of data.
4.
On-chain —— The user completes the transaction once all verifications are done.
The entire price oracle validation process is decentralized. There is no single point of failure and only two blocks are required to complete the entire process.
​
Binance Oracle Index price
The Binance Oracle Index price is a composite index derived from a basket of prices from major spot market exchanges, weighted by their respective trading volumes. Referenced trading markets include: Binance, Huobi, OKX, Bittrex, HitBTC, Gate.io, Bitmax, Bitfinex, Coinbase, Bitstamp, Kraken, Binance US and Bybit.
We also take additional protective measures to avoid poor market performance caused by interruptions and connectivity problems in spot markets. These protective measures are as follows:
Price Deviation from a Single Source:
When the Last Price of a particular exchange deviates more than 5% from the Median Price of all price sources, the price weight of that exchange will be set to zero.
Price Deviation from Multiple Sources:
If the Last Price of more than 1 exchange shows a deviation greater than 5%, the Median Price of all price sources will be used as the index value instead of the weighted average.
Exchange Connectivity Problems:
If we can't access the data feed for an exchange that had trades updated in the most recent 10 seconds, we can use price data from the latest result to calculate the Price Index.
If the trade data for an exchange has not been updated for 10 seconds, the weight of this exchange will be set to zero when calculating the weighted average.

📖
ApolloX Testnet Walk through
This is a detailed walk-through for those who are not that familiar with crypto or DeFi. Actually, the ApolloX Testnet is not that different from other testnets.
​
1. Brief Intro about ApolloX Trading V2
ApolloX is a decentralized derivatives trading platform. Users can start trading on the platform without registration or depositing funds. All transactions are executed on-chain and some trading pairs have zero slippage. This trading model has a low barrier to entry and those who hold or stake ALP can earn trading fee income and staking rewards.
​
2. Add BSC testnet network to your Metamask
The ApolloX team recommends you to use a new address for testnet activities. 


2.1 Click 'Settings' to add the BSC testnet network


​
​
2.2 Click 'Networks', then add the BSC testnet as below:


Testnet

New RPC URL: https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545/
ChainID: 97
Symbol: BNB
Block Explorer URL: 
https://testnet.bscscan.com
​
​
2.3 Return to the main page and check that your wallet has successfully added Testnet
3. How to get Testnet BNB?
You will need some testnet BNB to pay for gas fees, click to copy your address to the clipboard through 
https://testnet.bnbchain.org/faucet-smart
. Then you will receive testnet BNB successfully. 


For more guidance, please refer to https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/connecting-metamask-to-binance-smart-chain
​
4. How to get Testnet USDT&BUSD?
If you have not gotten the test tokens yet, kindly fill in your wallet address through 
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeIIUGS6bDkjgEZoJvEvaZMwA7FdeS5TadeXf9aH-n1g2UMrg/viewform
​
Our team will arrange the distribution of the test USDT&BUSD quickly. Rocket NFT holders should already have the test tokens in your wallet. 
​
5. How to trade on ApolloX Testnet?
First of all, please connect your wallet on 
https://www.apollox.finance/en/futures/v2/BTCUSD
. You can then select between market order and limit order to open the position. We also support stop loss and take profit functions, which would require you to select the percentage or input the target price manually. 
Then, click the confirmation button to confirm the gas fee and transaction.
After that, you will see your open positions.
6.

How to place stop orders?
Users can set 
[Take profit]
 and 
[Stop loss]
 orders when they are placing their orders. When opening a position, users can set a take profit or stop loss price. When the specified price is reached, the order will be executed. If UnrealizedPNL<= 90%, the user's position will be liquidated. At the same time, the unrealizedPNL cap of each trade will be 90%. Even if users do not place any take profit or stop loss orders, the unrealizedPNL cap will be set at 90% by default.

Position management
Users can check the details of their opened positions such as the opening price by clicking on "Position" located on the bottom of the trading page. They can view details such as opening price, number of positions, latest price and forced liquidation price.
Position mode
ApolloX will use isolated leverage mode for each v2 trading pair. Pairs operate independently: 
Each trading pair is an isolated position, Users can open multiple isolated positions
Every position (trading pair) runs independently. If users need to top up their margin, they will need to do so manually even if they have available assets in other separate positions (ApolloX will support auto top-up in the future)
Every isolated trading position will have its own risk rate and liquidation price, and will be settled individually
Liquidation risk is isolated for each trading pair. If a position is liquidated, it has no effect on other positions
Closing a position
Users can close their positions by clicking on "Close Position".

Fees & Slippage
Last modified

Section: 6_6_5_💡Fees & Slippage
💡
Fees & Slippage
Opening position fee
The fee for opening a cryptocurrency position is 0.08% and the fee for opening a FX position is 0.02%. 
Opening Fee=Number of Contracts*Entry Price * Opening Fee Rate
For example, if a trader opens a 1 ETH/USD long position at 1,500 USD, then the opening fee =1* 1,500*0.08%=1.2 USD.
​
Closing position fee
The fee for closing a cryptocurrency position is 0.08% and the fee for opening a FX position is 0.02%. 
Closing Fee=Number of Contracts*Close Price *Closing Fee Rate
For example, if a trader closes a 1 ETH/USD position at 1,600 USD, then the closing fee=1* 1,600*0.08%=1.28 USD
​
At the same time, in order to fulfill blockchain network costs and guarantee the normal functioning of the Keeper program — which helps to trigger and execute orders, users have to pay an execution fee.


Execution fee
The execution fee will only be charged when a position is opened. The execution fee is set at 0.3 USD.
​
Funding rate
The funding rate is used to balance the difference in the long-short ratio of the platform, to protect ALP from excessive risk exposure during transactions, and to minimize the holding position risk of the pool.
The funding rate on ApolloX is calculated every block. When the market changes, the accumulated funding fee is automatically calculated. The funding fee will be reflected in the unrealized PnL of the position, directly affecting the user’s liquidation price.
When long position traders are dominant, the funding rate is positive and long traders pay a funding fee to short traders. This increases as the long/short position gap widens. On the contrary, when short position traders are dominant, the funding rate is negative and short traders pay the funding fee to long traders. The detailed calculation is as below:
Funding Fee =(Number of Contracts * Mark Price) * Funding Fee Rate


Funding rate is calculated based on the gap between the long and short positions and current interest rate:
If Long OI >Short OI
Funding Fee Rate=Max{Floor,(Long OI - Short OI) * baseInterestRate/Long OI}
If Long OI <Short OI
Funding Fee Rate=-Max{Floor,(Short OI - Long OI) * baseInterestRate/Short OI}
If Long OI =Short OI
Funding Fee Rate=0


Base Interest Rate
Base Interest Rate Per Block = Base Interest Rate / (365*28200)
Based Interest Rate =  k*HV
k is the adjustment factor, the platform may be adjusted when k=1.25
HV is the historical volatility, HV = 2Week Average Volatility *365
For more information, please refer to the History Volatility & Base Interest Rate below

​
Liquidation 


Liquidation Price Distance = Entry Price * ( Initial Margin * Liquidation Lost Rate + CumFunding Fee) / Initial Margin / Leverage
​
Liquidation Price
Long: Entry Price - Liquidation Price Distance
Short : Entry Price + Liquidation Price Distance
​
Parameters: 
Entry Price is the price at which the traders opens a position 
Initial margin is the user’s initial collateral used as margin
Liquidation Lost Rate is the forced liquidation lost rate, and the default value is 90%
CumFunding Fee is the accumulated funding fee
Leverage is the user's selected leverage multiple


Example:
If the user opens a ETH/USD long position at 10x leverage, the entry price is 1,500, initial margin is 100, the funding fee is 2, the liquidation lost rate is 90%, then


Liquidation Price Distance = 1,500 * (100*90%+2) / 100 /10= 138
Liquidation Price = 1,500- 138 = 1,362
​
Slippage
Slippage on ApolloX will be adjusted based on the trading pair’s market depth determined by the Oracle. The platform will determine if the trading pair utilizes fixed slippage or dynamic slippage according to its liquidity from the oracle’s sources and this helps to prevent price manipulation at the same time. In general, slippage is positively correlated with open interest and newly opened positions, and is negatively correlated with the liquidity of the trading pair from the oracle's sources.
​
Fixed Slippage
When the user initiates an ETH/USD transaction, the price obtained by Binance Oracle is 1,500, and the slippage is 0.1%. Therefore, the user's entry price is 1,501.5, and the calculation formula is 1,500*(1500 * 0.1%)=1,501.5.
Since the liquidity of each trading pair in the oracle's source markets differs, the slippage of each trading pair is also different. In general, trading pairs with low liquidity have wider spreads. Users can check the specifics of each trading pair’s slippage on the trading page.
​
Dynamic Slippage


Dynamic slippage is different from fixed slippage. Dynamic slippage depends on the open interest of the trading pair, the position size of the trade, and the direction of the trade (long / short). Calculation:


Long_Dynamic Slippage (%)=(Long open interest + New trade position size )/ 1%DepthAbove
Short_Dynamic Slippage (%)=(Short open interest + New trade position size )/ 1%DepthBelow
​
Parameters:
Long open interest /Short open interest is the current value of the open positions of the trading pair
1%DepthAbove/ 1%DepthBelow is the current market depth +1%/-1% of a trading pair

Order Types
Market order: A market order is a buy or sell order that gets filled right away at the best price currently available on the market.
Limit order: A limit order lets you place an order at a specific price or a more favorable price. However, there's no guarantee that a limit order will be filled.
Limit buy orders are executed if the price of the asset hits the limit price or falls below that price.
Limit sell orders are executed if the price of the asset hits the limit price or rises above that price.
Do note that the opening fee and execution fee will be charged when a position is opened and this will be factored into the leverage amount.

Section: 7_1_💡What is Gas Fee?
💡
What is Gas Fee?
Gas fees are the incentives to miners to process transactions on the blockchain and to verify and secure the network. Gas fees do not go to ApolloX. Gas fees are determined by the Gas Price (GWEI) and the Gas Limit consumed. The Gas price depends on the network congestion and the Gas amount depends on the number of instructions involved in the transaction.
 
The calculation formula is: Gas Fees= Gas Limit x Gas Price
 
You can set the gas limit yourself when performing the transaction. It is important to note that the number of gas units required to complete a transaction depends on the complexity of the transaction. When a transaction is complex, it consumes more computing resources, hence the need to spend more Gas.
 
Gas Price refers to the number of Gwei, which affects how quickly your transactions are packaged by miners and put on the blockchain. If the Gas Price is set higher, it will give miners more incentive to package your transactions; Conversely, if gas price is set low, it will take longer time. If you're not in a hurry to close a deal, you can choose a lower Gas Price to save money. In each transaction, you can adjust the Gas Limit and Gas Price to suit your needs.
 
Notes: 
The gas fee for BSC is BNB. Please ensure that you have enough BNB in your wallet before proceeding with any transactions.

💡
The Wallet Password, Private Key and Seed Phrase
Password
 
When creating a wallet, you need to set a password of at least 8 characters. The wallet password is used to manage the wallet, e.g. to transfer funds, and must be entered when importing a wallet with a private key/seed phrase. The password set takes effect on your device only and ApolloX does not store your password. Therefore, kindly take note that the passwords you have set cannot be changed or reset. If the original password is forgotten, you are not able to retrieve it and you will need to remove the wallet and recreate a new one instead using your private key/seed phrase
. 
All wallets under ApolloX DeFi Wallet will share the same password.
 
Private key 
 
When dealing with cryptocurrency, a user is usually given a public address and a private key to send and receive coins or tokens. Anyone can deposit cryptocurrency in a public address, but funds cannot be removed from an address without the corresponding private key. 
 
The private key is typically a string of letters and numbers, which makes it hard for a hacker to crack. If a user loses their private key, they can no longer access the wallet to spend, withdraw, or transfer coins. It is, therefore, imperative to save the private key in a secure location.
 
On any wallet, by importing the private key and setting a new password you can import the assets from the previous A wallet into the B wallet. For example, if a mobile phone is lost, the assets can be recovered by simply importing the private key.
 
Seed Phrase
 
A seed phrase is a collection of words that can be used to access your cryptocurrency wallet. Because the private key is composed of 64-bit hexadecimal, which is inconvenient to record and copy. Usually, seed phrases are generated and consist of 12 words, with a space between each word. The seed phrases and private key have the same function, that is, you can import the wallet by entering the seed phrases and setting a new password.
