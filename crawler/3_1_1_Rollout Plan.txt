Rollout PlanThis page describes the launch plan of litmus parachain​✅ Phase 0 - Launch with Litmus genesisFollowing winning a Kusama parachain slot, the Litmus parachain was launched on Feb 20th with the genesis wasm. The initial launch will only include the minimum viable functionality to keep the chain running. It means:The parachain is running under the protection of a super-user (sudo pallet).Most of the other pallets are deactivated, including governance, balance transfer and all other feature modules.The users' activities are very limited in this phase.What users can doUsers will be able to observe block production and finalization via explorer (e.g. polkadot-js endpoint), and perform the read-only RPC queries to the chain state and storage.​✅ Phase 1 - Technical verification & Crowdloan distributionOnce Litmus goes live, we will start to keep track of the chain state and verify that everything goes fine, including block authorization and finalization, collator status, extrinsic testing and runtime upgradability etc.After we confirm that the parachain sits in a stable state and is running as expected, we will start to distribute the crowdloan rewards in LIT, with a linearly unlocked, per-block base. What users can doUsers can start to claim their crowdloan rewards. We will have a tutorial page later to explain how to claim it. Please note that the balance transfer remains deactivated, which means transferring the crowdloan reward to another account is still disabled.​✅ Phase 2 - Token migration & XCMA token migration mechanism with corresponding pallets will be activated, which allows the user to transfer ERC20 LIT tokens to Litmus parachain.What users can doUsers can optionally migrate their ERC20 LIT tokens to Litmus parachain. A guidance page will be added later to demonstrate how to make such a transfer.Initially, the token migration in this phase is uni-directional: ERC20 -> Litmus. However, we have now expanded the functionality and migration can also be done the other way round i.e Litmus -> ERC20.A cross-chain mechanism based on XCM with other parachains will be active. These parachains processing DEX features will make secondary market trading of LIT available.​✅ Phase 3 - Sudo removalAfter we confirm that the previous phases have been successfully carried out, we will start to activate the governance-related pallets in this phase with a subsequent sudo removal. From this point on, Limtus parachain will be fully governed by democracy, all on-chain state transitions that require sudo before will now have to go through a democratic process.What users can doUsers will be able to observe that the sudo key is completely removed from the Litmus parachain and the governance feature is activated, including council, technical committee, and referendum. LIT token holders can now take part in on-chain governance activities.​✅ Phase 4 - Balance transfer activationBalance transfer will be enabled in this phase through a democratic runtime upgrade. What users can doUsers will be able to freely transfer their funds between accounts.Note that Balance transfer and XCM are two independent mechanisms. So without balance transfer enabled, our users can still use the XCM function freely.Phase 5 - Feature pallets onboard More feature pallets will be gradually onboarded in this phase. They are bound up with the Litentry products which widen the LIT token usage scenarios and bring the integrative service experience to the users.The feature pallets are expected to contain but are not limited to:Credit computation service with TEE​Identity Management PalletVC Management PalletParachain Staking PalletNFT-based use casesWhat users can doUsers will be able to take part in the various products and services firsthand and discover the diverse LIT token utilities.Depending on the development progress, some pallets could be experienced earlier than planned, in the form of internal/public testing.PreviousLitmus NetworkNextCollatorLast modified 2mo agoCopy linkOn this page Phase 0 - Launch with Litmus genesis Phase 1 - Technical verification & Crowdloan distribution Phase 2 - Token migration & XCM Phase 3 - Sudo removal Phase 4 - Balance transfer activationPhase 5 - Feature pallets onboard
