BackgroundBrief introduction to TEE backgroundTo perform the account linking from various providers and an aggregated DID solution in a secure and privacy-preserving way, TEE is used to wrap around the core computational service.TEE (trusted execution environment) is a secure area of the main processor which guarantees code and data loaded inside to be protected with respect to confidentiality and integrity. In Litentry, TEE also represents the whole solution for data protection in parachain, the encrypted data processing in the side chain and all Dapps.The most important technology stacks among them are:​Intel SGX (Software Guard Extension)
A new instruction set in Skylake Intel CPUs since autumn 2015. Every node in the side chain must support SGX​Rust SDK
The TEE device is bare metal, so the SDK is different from SDK based on OS, which provides services like a system-level library, file system and so on. A dedicated rust SDK was provided by rust community and now it is open source and becomes the Apache incubated project.​Substrate
A next-generation framework for blockchain innovation. Substrate takes a modular approach to blockchain development and defines a rich set of primitives that allows developers to make use of powerful, familiar programming idioms.​Integritee
The most scalable public blockchain solution for securely processing sensitive business or personal data. It harnesses the speed and confidentiality of trusted execution environments, combined with the trust of a decentralized network.In the next chapter, we will present the overarching architecture and workflow for the Litentry solution.PreviousTEENextTEE - FAQLast modified 1mo agoCopy link
