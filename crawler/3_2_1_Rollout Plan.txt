Rollout PlanThis page describes the launch plan of Litentry parachain​✅ Phase 0 - Launch with Litentry genesisFollowing winning a Polkadot parachain slot on Apr 25th , the Litentry parachain was launched on Jun 4th with the genesis wasm. The initial launch will only include the minimum viable functionality to keep the chain running. It means:The parachain is running under the protection of a super-user (sudo pallet).Most of the other pallets are deactivated, including governance, balance transfer and all other feature modules.The users' activities are very limited in this phase.What users can doUsers will be able to observe block production and finalization via explorer (e.g. polkadot-js endpoint), and perform the read-only RPC queries to the chain state and storage.​✅ Phase 1 - Technical verification & Crowdloan distributionOnce Litentry goes live, we will start to keep track of the chain state and verify that everything goes fine, including block authorization and finalization, collator status, extrinsic testing and runtime upgradability etc. Most of Litmus features are available on Litentry, and we will make runtime upgrade for new features constantly in future, after Litmus confirm them fully tested and robust.After we confirm that the parachain sits in a stable state and is running as expected, we will start to distribute the crowdloan rewards in LIT, with a linearly unlocked, per-block base. What users can doUsers can start to claim their crowdloan rewards. We will have a tutorial page later to explain how to claim it. Please note that the balance transfer remains deactivated, which means transferring the crowdloan reward to another account is still disabled.​✅ Phase 2 - Token migration & XCM A token migration mechanism with corresponding pallets will be activated, which allows the user to transfer ERC20 LIT tokens to Litentry parachain.What users can doUsers can optionally migrate their ERC20 LIT tokens to Litentry parachain. A guidance page will be added later to demonstrate how to make such a transfer.Please note the token migration in this phase is uni-directional: ERC20 -> Litentry. We will expand it to allow the other direction in the near future.A cross-chain mechanism based on XCM with other parachains will be active. These parachains processing DEX features will make secondary market trading of LIT available.Phase 3 - Collator StakingUnlike Litmus, Litentry will have an extended staking mechanism based on Polkadot's Proof-of-Stake model as well as a delegation feature, making it a Delegated Proof of Stake(DPoS) setup.Collators are initially maintained by Litentry team and users make a delegation request through staking, which allows users to participate in the block reward process.Please refer toLitentry collator model for more informationPhase 4 - Sudo removalAfter we confirm that the previous phases have been successfully carried out, we will start to activate the governance-related pallets in this phase with a subsequent sudo removal. From this point on, Litentry parachain will be fully governed by democracy, all on-chain state transitions that require sudo before will now have to go through a democratic way.What users can doUsers will be able to observe that the sudo key is completely removed from the Litentry parachain and the governance feature is activated, including council, technical committee and referendum. The LIT token holders can now take part in the on-chain governance activities.Phase 5 - Balance transfer activationBalance transfer will be enabled in this phase through a democratic runtime upgrade. What users can doUsers will be able to freely transfer their funds between accounts.Notice that Balance transfer and XCM are independent two mechanisms. So without balance transfer enabled, users can still use the XCM function freely.Phase 6 - Feature pallets onboard More feature pallets will be gradually onboarded in this phase. They are bound up with the Litentry products which widen the LIT token usage scenarios and bring the integrative service experience to the users.The feature pallets are expected to contain but are not limited to:Crowdloan Distribution (Linear Vesting Unlock)A bidirectional token bridge between ERC20 LIT tokens and Litentry parachain (first unidirectional, then extend to both directions)XCM cooperation with available Defi-hub (e.g. Moonbeam/Acala) to liquidate and invest LIT in their financial productsXCM support between Litmus and Litentry (This work is dependent on the official Polkadot <> Kusama bridge)Activation of PoS collation and collator-related staking (Please note this is for the Litentry parachain only, not on Litmus)Cooperation with PNS (Polkadot Name Systems)LIT utility: On-chain governance and tip/bounty programLIT utility: Privacy-preserving identity aggregation service with MCP (MyCryptoProfile)LIT utility: Privacy-preserving airdrop distribution and claiming service with Drop3​Privacy-preserving anti-fraud scoring service (with Drop3 and Litentry Graph)...What users can doUsers will be able to take part in the various products and services firsthand and discover the diverse LIT token utilities.Depending on the development progress, some pallets could be experienced earlier than planned, in the form of internal/public testing.PreviousLitentry NetworkNextCollatorLast modified 2mo agoCopy linkOn this page Phase 0 - Launch with Litentry genesis Phase 1 - Technical verification & Crowdloan distribution Phase 2 - Token migration & XCM Phase 3 - Collator StakingPhase 4 - Sudo removalPhase 5 - Balance transfer activationPhase 6 - Feature pallets onboard
