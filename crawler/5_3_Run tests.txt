Run testsYou might want to try out the pre-written tests locally.run ts-tests locallyTo run the ts-tests (the test under ts-tests/ folder) locally, similar to launching the networks, it's possible to run them in either docker or binary mode:make test-ts-docker-litentryor# if on Linuxmake test-ts-binary-litentry​# otherwise./scripts/launch-local-binary.sh litentry path-to-polkadot-bin path-to-litentry-parachain-bin./scripts/run-ts-test.shBe sure to run the clean-up afterwards.The make test-ts-* command above will also launch the dev network before running the test, so you don't have to do it again.If you already have a running network, simply run  ./scripts/run-ts-test.sh to execute ts-tests.run runtime integration testThere're also integration tests for Litmus and Litentry runtime which are written in rust.
