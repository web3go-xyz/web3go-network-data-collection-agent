TEEEntry page for TEEOverviewA Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is an environment for executing code, in which those executing the code can have high levels of trust in the asset management of that surrounding environment because it can ignore threats from the “unknown” rest of the device.Trusted applications running in a TEE have access to the full power of a device's main processor and memory, whereas hardware isolation protects these components from user installed applications running in the main operating system. Software and cryptographic isolations inside the TEE protect the different contained trusted applications from each other.To achieve identity aggregation, Litentry has a requirement of storing sensitive user data, like user's Ethereum account and computed credit score. And the TEE has been chosen as a fundamental approach to guarantee the security of data storage and data processing. Litentry builds a side chain, which is composed of multiple TEE equipped nodes, to make sure of storing and processing data in a distributed way, without exposing user's private data.This chapter:introduces the background knowledge of TEE explains the architecture of Litentry solution via diagramsdepicts the core components that are involved in the architectureprovides a guide to building and executing code examples (WIP)Outlines:BackgroundTEE - FAQArchitecture diagramCore componentsPreviousToken Bridge CommissionNextBackgroundLast modified 1mo agoCopy linkOn this pageOverviewOutlines:
