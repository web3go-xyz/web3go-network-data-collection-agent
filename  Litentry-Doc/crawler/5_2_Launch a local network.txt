Launch a local networkHow to get our parachain running on localhostA minimum local dev network consists of 2 relay chain nodes and 1 parachain node. To launch it, there're two ways (taking litentry as an example, litmus is similar):using docker images (preferred)1.make sure docker and yarn are installed2.git clone https://github.com/litentry/litentry-parachain​3.cd litentry-parachain4.make launch-docker-litentryBoth parity/polkadot and litentry/litentry-parachain images will be pulled from upstream automatically. Additionally, parachain-launch will be installed and used to generate chain-specs and docker-compose files.The generated files will be under docker/generated-litentry/.​Wait a while until you see such logs:logs showing that the network is launched successfullyUp to this point the network is launched successfully.You should be able to connect to the chain websocket via browser:​https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9944#/explorer for relay chains​https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9946#/explorer for parachainWhen finished with the dev network, run make clean-docker-litentry to stop the docker containers and tidy things upusing raw binariesOnly when option 1 doesn't work and you suspect the docker-image went wrong. In this case we could try to launch the dev network with raw binaries.On Linux host:you should have the locally compiled ./target/release/litentry-collator binary.run make launch-binary-litentryOn Non-Linux host:you should have locally compiled binaries, for both polkadot and litentry-collatorrun ./scripts/launch-local-binary.sh litentry <path-to-polkadot-bin> <path-to-litentry-parachain-bin>Likewise, when finished with the dev network, run make clean-binary to stop the processes and tidy things up.Note this command should work for both litentry and litmus.extend the leasing periodThe default leasing duration for parachain is 1 day, in case you want to extend it (even after it's downgraded to parathread), simply do a forceLease via sudo, it should be upgraded to parachain soon again and start to produce blocks.polkadot-js extrinsic to extend the leasing periodYou can also refer to README on https://github.com/litentry/litentry-parachain​PreviousBuild parachainNextRun testsLast modified 2mo agoCopy linkOn this pageusing docker images (preferred)using raw binariesextend the leasing period
