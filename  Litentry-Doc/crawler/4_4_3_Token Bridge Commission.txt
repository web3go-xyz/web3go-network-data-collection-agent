Token Bridge CommissionThis treatise explains the Litentry crosschain bridge token commission fee to give our users an understanding of how it works.IntroductionCross-chain bridge serves as a neutral zone that enables users to deploy assets for fast and easy transactions irrespective of the blockchain network. It also reduces operational difficulties by allowing access to multiple blockchains through the same network.Litentry has developed a Crosschain Bridge that works in the same way and all its components are built in a standardized fashion to help unlock the superior liquidity in the DOTSAMA ecosystem. The crosschain bridge allows users to seamlessly send and receive LIT tokens between Polkadot and Kusama (Parachain LIT) and the Ethereum network (ERC-20 LIT).To achieve this, Litentry uses a ChainBridge Relayer model that calls smart contract functions based on the transaction direction (LIT ⇌ ERC-20 LIT) and allows the Bridge Pallet to mint or burn LIT for the appropriate transaction to be carried out.Bridge Transfer Fee Calculation(Parachain LIT → Erc20-LIT)For every Bridge transaction that occurs within the Litentry protocol, there are three ChainBridge relayers that are responsible for the approval or rejection of the transaction.Litentry Relayer Network/Address InfoWe use 3 relay servers to submit and execute proposals for smart contracts and a proposal needs to get 2/3 votes to get executed. The reason for it is to prevent a single point of failure and minimize the risk of hacking and malicious attacksSo basically cross chain transactions from parachain(both Litmus and Litentry) to ERC20-LIT would result in 6 transactions on Ethereum, that's where the commission comes from. For every transaction, there are six relayer executions and at least two of the relayers must successfully execute the following two triggers (a total of 4 executions) for a transaction to be approved:Vote ProposalExecute ProposalWhile the opposite is the case for failed transactions.The remaining two triggers (to make 6 executions) are:Failed Vote ProposalFailed Execute ProposalIt is important to note that the smart contract charges different fees for each of the triggers executed by the Relayers as evident below:TitleCostExecution statusInitial Gas Price on Ethereum25 Gwei​Success VoteProposal Fee0.002552 ETH2 timesFailed VoteProposal Fee0.0005425 ETH1 timesSuccess ExecuteProposal Fee0.00123 ETH1 timesFailed ExecuteProposal Fee0.000559ETH2 timesLIT/ETH Ratio0.000773 LIT/ETH​​​​Fee based on LIT10.34253 LIT​The Commission Fee is calculated based on the following methods:CommissionFee = (SucessVoteProposalFee x 2 + FailedVoteProposalFee + SucessExecuteProposalFee x 2 + FailedExecuteProposalFee)/( LIT/ETH Ratio)The total fee charged by the smart contract for each of the Relayer triggers is then divided by the LIT/ETH ratio provided by Binance which amounts to approximately 10 LIT for Crosschain Bridge transactions.PreviousArchitecture modelNextTEELast modified 1mo agoCopy linkOn this pageIntroductionBridge Transfer Fee Calculation(Parachain LIT → Erc20-LIT)
